# Proposed Solution
We propose a **Centralized DCA Management System** with **AI-based orchestration** that integrates with legacy\
systems and ensures **robust governance** through compliance controls, audit trails, and performance\
analytics. \
**Centralised DCA Platform** → Single system to govern and control all DCA operations.\
**Invoice-to-Case Automation** → Converts overdue invoices into actionable cases automatically.\
**AI Prioritisation Engine** → Scores cases by recovery likelihood and sensitivity.\
**Smart Case Allocation** → Assigns cases to the right DCA based on AI + rules.\
**SOP & SLA Automation** → Enforces workflows, timelines, and auto-escalations.\
**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** → Secure, permission-based access for FedEx teams.\
**DCA Collaboration Portal** → Clear tasks, real-time updates, and proof uploads.\
**Real-Time Dashboards** → Live recovery, SLA, and DCA performance insights.\
**Audit & Compliance Layer** → Complete traceability for every action taken.\
**Legacy Integration (RPA / APIs)** → Works seamlessly with existing billing systems.\
